# Python-projects
Interesting Python applications and projects developed on my own.

  - **Contact Information** :
         A Python project that creates contact information in which the user can add a new contact, edit and delete existing contacts and view all the                                 contact using Tkinter and SQLite. Tkinter library for rendering graphics and SQlite is used for the database.
  - **Automated job pages web scraping using Selenium** :
         This automation script streamlines the process of extracting job-related data from LinkedIn, saving time and effort by automating repetitive tasks involved in 
          navigating and gathering information from multiple pages.
